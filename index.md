## First blood
Welcome on superpun.ch ! Amazing average content from deep societal subjects. 

## Limited ?
Wonder if this page github stuff is enough for a blog... maybe not. How to add comments ? How to tag posts ? What I need is an easy to edit / add posts blog with an easy spam proof comments system and with MD support. Edit an md file, then the website create the post based on the md. Maybe I have to dig a little bit more in Jekyll, it may be possibe...
